The Importance of Parents Being Involved in Their Children’s Lives
This project explores the relationship between parental involvement in their children’s lives and academic performance. We collected data through a survey conducted in various regions, which we then processed and analyzed using Python. We found that there is a strong correlation between parental involvement and academic success.

Dataset
We collected data through a survey that was conducted in various regions. The survey asked questions related to parental involvement in their children’s lives and their academic performance. The dataset we used contained over 1000 responses.

Data Processing
We processed the data using Python. We cleaned the dataset by removing any invalid or incomplete responses. We then conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data.

Research
After conducting exploratory data analysis, we did further research to identify the most important factors that contribute to academic success. We found that parental involvement in their children’s lives, such as attending parent-teacher conferences and helping with homework, is one of the most important factors.

Visualizations
We used Tableau to create various visualizations that help us understand the relationship between parental involvement and academic success. These visualizations include scatter plots, bar charts, and heat maps.

Conclusion
Our findings suggest that parental involvement is a crucial factor in determining academic success. Parents should make an effort to be involved in their children’s lives, such as attending parent-teacher conferences and helping with homework, to ensure their academic success.In addition to the findings related to parental involvement and academic success, our analysis also uncovered some interesting insights related to family dynamics. We found that spending time together as a family, such as going to the movies or attending sporting events, is positively correlated with academic success.
However, we also found that parental separation can lead to delinquent acts among juveniles. Children from separated families are more likely to engage in delinquent behaviors than children from intact families.
Furthermore, we found that problems with alcohol or drugs in parents can have a significant negative impact on children's academic performance and overall well-being. It's essential for parents to seek help if they are struggling with substance abuse issues to ensure the well-being of their children.
Finally, we developed a derived feature to identify the most important family-related factors that contribute to delinquent behavior. This feature can be used to develop targeted interventions to prevent delinquent behavior among juveniles.
